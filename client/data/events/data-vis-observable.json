In this talk we'll explore some ways that data visualization can help us better understand & make decisions about our open-source projects. We'll learn how to create insightful visualizations of Github data using Observable, which lets us quickly create interactive prototypes by forking & remixing visualizations from the community to adapt them to our projects."

As a developer advocate at Observable, these days she codes & teaches from her home base in San Francisco; in the before-times, you could find her speaking at events around the world. She loves to share the joy of programming and advocate for a more diverse, equitable, and ethical tech industry. Ask her about the Recurse Center & Outreachy, sheâ€™s an alumna of both! "
