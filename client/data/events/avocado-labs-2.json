At Auth0 we're trying to make authentication and identification as easy as possible, while still keeping it secure.\nAfter office hours I like to play around with the web-audio API, and other \"exotic\" browser APIs. One of my side projects is a library to add audio effects to an audio input using JavaScript."

In Spain, where she’s currently based, she’s an organiser of GDG Vigo and the founder of GalsTech, a group for women in tech from Galicia. Because she is so passionate about diversity, she has also been named a Women Techmaker Ambassador."
