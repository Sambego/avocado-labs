            "description": "As developers, we release features daily – but how do you ensure those features are working properly in production before you release them to all your users? If you ask me, the answer is feature flags! Feature flags are beneficial because they allow you to test your code in production, perform canary releases, and even conduct A/B testing. The power of React makes it easy to implement these flags. We will walk through how to easily create a feature flag in the UI, install dependencies with npm, and implement your feature flag in your react app."
