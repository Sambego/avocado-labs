A dream Today, our industry is not on the path to achieve that dream. We need to change our technology-first approach to a people-centric one based on trust to get back on track. In this talk, we’ll talk about Security Culture, what trust is, and how to extend and inspire trust. We’ll follow almost exactly the same method that FBI hostage negotiators use on their day today. It doesn’t get more battle tested than that."
